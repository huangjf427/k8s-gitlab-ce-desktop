I search on GitHub to find a reference for my testing enviroment. The propose of the testing is to setup gitlib-ce with kubernetes of Docker Desktop that launched in Windows platform.

I found this "templates" from Amine's project which named monolith-gitlab-k8s.

Belowing statements are from Amine:

//
This project is intended as a **template** to those who want to deploy Gitlab-CE to Kubernetes without using the Helm chart. 

Since this is a template, it might not suit your production needs. You will certainly need to edit it.
